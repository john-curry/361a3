Structure:
  The program is losely structured as a Model/View/Controller where the 
  connections class is the controller, the view is the << operator which
  is overloaded for the models which are the connection and packet classes.

  Packets are encapsulate in the packet class located in the packet.h file. 

  A single connection is in the connection class located in the connection.h file.

  Connections are managed by the connections class in the connections.h file.

  Packets are processed as they come in. The connections class checks to see if the packet
  is part of a already existing connection, otherwise it is passed to the connection it is
  associated with. Packets are checked in the check_packet function of the connection class.
  
  Packets are processed by their respective connections in the recv_packet function of the
  connection class. 

  Printing is done in the print.cpp file.
